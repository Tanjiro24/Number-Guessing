Number-Guessing Game:

A Number Guessing Game is a fun, interactive web application where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. Using HTML, you create the structure for input fields, buttons, and feedback displays. With CSS, you style the game interface for an engaging user experience. JavaScript powers the game logic, generating the random number, comparing the player's guess, and providing feedback (e.g., "Too High" or "Too Low") until the correct number is guessed. Itâ€™s a great project to practice DOM manipulation and event handling!
